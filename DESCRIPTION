Description: This package creates BetaTrees histogram. The partition is obtained by growing
    a kd tree on the order statistics, then on each node (i.e. region) that is bounded, do a goodness of fit (GOF) test to decide whether
    that region is good representation or needs to split into (grand)children. Test by using as 
    test sets all nodes that are contained in that node (i.e. children, grandchildren...)
    For GOF use exact beta confidence bounds from Wald's lemma, and get guaranteed
    simultaneous level alpha by weighted Bonferroni.

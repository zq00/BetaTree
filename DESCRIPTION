Description: Creates a Beta Tree histogram. Iteratively partition the space by by growing
    a kd tree on the order statistics. For each node, computes an exact confidence bound from Wald's lemma, and get guaranteed
    simultaneous level alpha by weighted Bonferroni. Construct the histogram by selecting the largest node
    that passes a goodness-of-fit test.
